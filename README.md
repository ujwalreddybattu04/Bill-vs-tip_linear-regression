# Bill-vs-tip_linear-regression
--------------------------------------------------Readme---------------------------------------------------------
Project Description
The objective of this project is to build a Linear Regression model that predicts the tip amount based on the given total bill amount. The dataset contains various columns such as the total bill, tip, day of the week, time of the day, and others. In this project, the focus is on predicting tips using the total bill as the input feature.\
Dataset
The dataset used is built into Seaborn as the tips dataset. It contains the following columns:

total_bill: The total bill amount (in dollars).
tip: The tip amount (in dollars).
sex: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).
smoker: Whether the customer was a smoker or not.
day: Day of the week (e.g., Thurs, Fri, Sat, Sun).
time: Time of the day (Lunch/Dinner).
size: Number of people in the group.
Model Performance Metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.62
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.57
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.75
